# Weather_Dashboard

## Background

As a traveler, I want the ability for the traveler to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they are able to plant their trip according to the weather


## Weather Search Targets
- When given this weather dashboard the user is able to type inputs for a city and in turn they are presented with the current and future conditions for that searched city. Additionally, the city is added to the search history.
- Upon the user search, they are presented with the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
- When viewing the UV index, the user is presented with a color indicating weather conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
- When the user views the future conditions for a given city they are presented with a 5-day forecast displaying the date, an icon weather condition representation, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
